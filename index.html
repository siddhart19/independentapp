            My name is Dimple Rana. I am a mother of two sons Siddharth and Paarth and married for almost a decade to Mr. Sandeep Rana. I am also a passionate PYP educator at Oberoi International school. In my leisure time, I like to dance to the tune of bollywood music and also watch movies. I enjoy travelling with family and go out on adventures with my friends. I hate dishonesty and talking behind the back.
            
            I was born in Mumbai however my roots belong to Hamirpur - a beautiful district in Himachal Pradesh, India. I am a proud mumbaikar and can speak and write English, Hindi and Marathi fluently. I enjoy eating the street food like pavbhaji and pani puri a lot.
            
            My aim in life is to be someone who would be remembered for the person who I am and hence potray strong beliefs in my values of honesty, love and hardwork.
